Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment arms: Arm A (pralsetinib) or Arm B (investigator's choice of either cabozantinib or vandetanib for adults and vandetanib for adolescents). Participants whose disease progresses during SOC treatment will be offered the option to cross over to receive pralsetinib after confirmation of progressive disease by blinded independent central review (BICR).",
